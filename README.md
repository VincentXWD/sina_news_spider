# sina_news_spider
### Here's a web spider aims to crawl the news from sina news in english.
### Because of golang's feature, you just need to copy the binary file to your linux server and run it.
### When you run the sina_news_spider. Here're two main directories named 'result' and 'catalog' the spider will create.

### ./result/ saves the news divided by the special coverage and subject. Each special coverage also has a .usns file saves the urls of subjects under this special coverage.
### ./result/[special coverage]/[subject]/ saves the news with the news' id and .sns suffix.

### ./catalog/ saves all paths of files that this spider created.
### ./catalog/[special coverage]/ saves the files' paths relate this special coverage.

### \*.snp saves the news' paths.
### ./catalog/\*.usns saves the subjects' paths under the special coverage.
### ./result/\*.usns saves the urls.
### ./result/[special coverage]/[subject]/\*.sns saves the news with 4 lines are subject, title, time, article.

### Enjoy it and forgive my poor English :-)
